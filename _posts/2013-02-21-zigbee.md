原来在学校看zigbee的时候觉得很蛋疼，这次在里里先看`zigbee wireless networks and transceivers`的第三章，然后结合z-stack，了解了应用层APS、ZDO、AF这些元素，然后看`zigbee wireless networks`才把一些问题解决。

#1.zigbee的应用层
应用层由Application support Layer、Zigbee Device Object、Application Framework这几个部件构成。

觉得zigbee的书难理解的原因是，我想弄明白有的传输过程是怎么样实现的好与计算机网络还对比下，但是一般的书都注重概念。

Zigbee寻址就是，一个Node(设备)里可以有很多个Endpoint，一个Application就基于一个Endpoint的，可以为这个Endpoint指定一个Profile。Endpoint里面就是Cluster，一个Cluster也像一个地址这样的东东。

发送一个数据就是用：设备地址、Endpoint、Cluster来定位的，这个数据就最终发到这个Cluster对应用的处理函数。

从Zigbee协议栈的网络层到了应用层的包结构为：｜端点号｜Cluster ID｜发给Cluster的数据|

然后在Cluster数据上又实现了ZCL这一层。

Zigbee应用层发送东西就是发送到

#2.Application support Layer
APS提供两种服务：data、management

data service由APS Data Entity(APSDE)提供，通过APSDE Service Aeccess Point(SAP)访问。

manage service由APS management entity提供，通过APSME SAP访问。

AF层就使用APSDE。ZDO使用了APSDE和APSME。

#3.Application Framework
先讲AF的原因是，ZDO有一部分是与AF层一样的。

Endpoint Addressing(端点寻址)允许多个设备(开关、灯泡)使用同一个radio。

Application Profile用来开发一个Application。Application Profile=Zigbee Profile。一个profile使用profile identify来标识。

只有zigbee allionce能签发profile identify。Home automation application profile就是这个组织弄出的一个的profile。

弄这样profile的目的是为了能生产出兼容的设备。

一个开关可以在商业(建筑那什么profile)和家庭环境销售，这个设备就支持两种profile，由两个Endpoint实现(ZWN那本书)。

Application Profile包含两个重要的组件：device decriptions和clusters。

device decriptions由5部分组成：Node Decriptor、Node Power Descriptor、simple Decriptor、Complex Descriptor、User Descriptor构成。

其中重要的就是Simple Descriptor，他下面还有这个Endpoint支持的InCluster和OutCluster。

现在还不懂OutCluster有些什么用，接收数据时用的都是InCluster吧。

#ZDO
ZDO与AF层的那些Endpoint不同的是，他是Endpoint 0。

像IEEE_addr_req这些东东，他其实也是有对应的Cluster ID。ZDO是协议栈的一部分，当ZDO收到发外Cluster的数据后，他还需要访问APSME和网络层的管理接口。

对于ZDO来讲，他其实本质上与AF层那些东西一样，但是就是有预先程序来处理这些cluster收到的数据。然后根据这些数据可能要访问其它的管理接口。

#binding
有两种binding:APS binding和ZDO Binding。

binding就是保存远端的地址(网络，组什么的)，发往某个Cluster的数据，在没有指定设备地址的情况下，可以从绑定表获得远端的地址。

APS binding用专门的函数实现。

ZDO Binding的ZDO_END_DEVICE_BIND_REQ由一个设备发给另一设备和另另一个设备绑定。而ZDO_BIND_REQ和APS binding差不多。

#ZCL
ZWN那本书的6.1 ZCL Foundation来讲这个。

ZCL为Zigbee规范加入了attributes和commands的概念。

Attributes是定义在cluster里的data items或states。

Commands是cluster要表现的动作。

HA的例子，HA On/Off Light使用On/Off Cluster(0x0006)，一个属性用来表示电灯的开和关，还有命令来控制电灯on、off、toggle。

`ZCL就是把发往Cluster的数据，再定义一下，实现这些东东。`

ZCL还实现了PUSH和PULL这样的东东。

PUSH就是设备发送报告当属性改变时(对于z-stack来说见其文档)

PULL就是向设备请求数据。

#NWK Layer
##ZWN-7.2 Forming, Joining, and Rejoining ZigBee Networks

Many stack vendors
offer the ability to have a node designated as a ZC, ZR, or ZED at compile time (to save
code and RAM) or at run-time (to reduce OEM-manufactured parts)

###7.2.1 Forming Networks
ZC形成网络时决定PAN ID和挑选channel。

在形成网络的过程中，一个包在每个channel都发送，如果这个channel没有其他风络，sniffer就只会看见这一个包。

So how do you know which channel and PAN ID the ZC has chosen?

Joining a network is a process of discovering what networks and nodes are in the vicinity,
and then choosing one of them to join. Provided the association is acceptable to the
network, the join will be completed, and the joining node will now have an address on
that network.
The joining node initiates the process, shouting “Hey, is anyone out there?” using a
beacon request (see Figure 7.4). Any ZCs and ZRs in the vicinity respond, saying “Here
I am” using a beacon. Although not technically accurate according to the 802.15.4
specification, I often call the beacons “beacon responses,” because that’s how they
are processed: A node sends out a beacon request, other nodes respond with a beacon
response.

##7.2.3 Rejoining Networks
Rejoining assumes that the node has already joined the network, that the node has a
proper PAN ID, extended PAN ID, security key, and short address. There are several
reasons why a node might need to rejoin the network:
● A ZED has lost contact with its parent
● Power has been cycled, and many or all nodes in the network rejoin “silently”
● Joining a secure network if permit-joining is off

##
Another type of rejoining is silent rejoin. Silent rejoin is something you won’t find in the
ZigBee specification, but all stack vendors provide it because it is necessary in a deployed
network of any size. For example, imagine that the power is cycled to all the routers in
a 1,000-node network, during a temporary outage in a building. When the power comes
back on, if all nodes attempted to join (or rejoin) at once, the networking in all probability
would largely fail: there would simply be too much traffic.

Chapter 7
But since routers already know their network information (PAN ID, Extended PAN
ID, NwkAddr, security key), they can simply start silently, without saying anything.
Remember, ZigBee nodes don’t need to talk to maintain status on the network. The power
outage can be looked at as equivalent to the network simply not talking for a while. As
power comes back on, each router goes into receive mode on the exact PAN ID, Extended
PAN ID, NwkAddr and security, as if the network had never been turned off. This is
called “Silent Rejoin.”



#The commissioning cluster
这玩意是建立在ZCL上的一层，用来设置网络参数。

The commissioning primitives can be found in a variety of ZigBee components, including the NWK layer, APS, ZDO, ZDP, and the ZigBee Cluster Library. An application running in a node has full access to all of these primitives. Most commissioning primitives are available in both local and over-the-air forms:

● ZigBee Device Object (ZDO) contains methods for finding and joining the network in various ways, calling on the NWK layer to do some of this work.

● ZigBee Device Profile (ZDP) contains device (node) and service (application) discovery, as well as remote table-management functions.

● ZigBee Cluster Library (ZCL) provides over-the-air group and scene management.

● The Commissioning Cluster provides a standard over-the-air means for setting up security keys, PAN IDs, the channel mask, and manager addresses.

##`ZDP, ZCL, and the Commissioning Cluster are used only after a node is on a network.`

##ZDP的一些用处

The major ZDP commissioning commands are shown in the following list. See Chapter 5,
“ ZigBee, ZDO, and ZDP,” for a more detailed explanation:
● ZDP-Bind, ZDP-Unbind, and ZDP-End-Device-Bind add and remove entries
   from remote binding tables.
● ZDP-Simple-Descriptor-Request and ZDP-Active-Endpoint-Request and
   ZDP-Match-Descriptor determine which applications exist on remote nodes.
● ZDP-IEEE-Address-Request can find all the nodes on the network (just start at
   the ZC).
● ZDP-Mgmt-Bind can determine which applications are bound to which.
● ZDP-Permit-Joining-Request enables and disables permit-join in the network.


##8.2 The Commissioning Cluster

The SAS parameters (see Table 8.2) only take effect after the node is reset by the
Commissioning Cluster command Restart Device Request. Until then, they are merely
settings in a table in RAM in the remote node.

只有用Commissioning Cluster command重启设备后SAS parameters才起作用，那它之前连到哪个网络去？

##
8.3 Example 1: Simple Commissioning
One of the simplest commissioning techniques is that employed by the ZigBee Home
Automation Application Profile. The installer of this network is expected to be either a
home owner or a professional installer. Either way, the installer is definitely not expected
to be computer expert. In the simplest case, the installer turns on the devices and they just
work. In more complicated situations, pressing a few buttons does the trick.

上面讲设备安装的事。

##

The node starts out knowing nothing but its own MAC address and Application Profile. It
has no PAN ID (set to 0xffff), it has no extended PAN ID (set to 0x0000000000000000),
it has no channel (channel mask is set to 0x07fff800), it has no network key, and it has no
profile ID (it will join either stack profile 0x01 or 0x02).

设备不知道关于网络的任何参数

When power is applied, the node begins scanning for networks. As soon as it finds one
with permit-join enabled, it joins that network and receives its short address and network
key (in the clear with a transport key) from its parent.

设备扫描网络，设备加上任何可以允许其加入的网络

The only widget which forms a ZigBee network in the example above is the ZigBee
Network Coordinator (ZC). The ZC will form a network using its MAC address as its
extended PAN ID, and a random PAN ID. It will form the PAN randomly on one of the
preferred channels for HA: 11, 14, 15, 19, 20, 24, or 25. The ZC will leave permit-join
enabled for two minutes when it is first plugged in or after the user presses the “Add
ZigBee Devices.” Once it has formed the network, it saves this information to non-
volatile memory, so that power can be interrupted with no harm to the network. It also
includes a recessed “reset” switch that can put it back into factory reset.

刚开始两分钟，允许加入网络。

The switches and remote control devices are sleepy ZigBee End devices (ZEDs). The
lights are ZigBee Routers (ZRs), both of which are device types that attempt to join
a ZigBee network. Remember, they will join any network, any PAN ID, any channel.
The ZRs and ZEDs will scan for networks on all the channels and then attempt to join.

设备可以加入任何网络。

The only potential problem with this easy-joining scheme occurs if two or more installers
(perhaps neighbors in an apartment or condominium) attempt to add ZigBee devices
to their network at the same time. This is unlikely, but possible. The troubleshooting
solution is simply to reset the joining devices and try again

潜在的问题是：你邻居家的协调器也同时允许设备加入，发生了这样的事，只有重启设备。

If “away,” it will attempt a rejoin every 30 seconds, which may get the same parent or
not. When rejoin is successful, the node goes to “home” state.

##8.4 Example 2: Commercial Commissioning

These devices (lights, switches, door locks, thermostats, etc.), which may originate from
multiple OEMs (perhaps Philips lights, Trane thermostats, and Schneider Electric air
conditioners) are set up out-of-the-box to automatically join the commissioning network
on extended PAN ID 0x00f0c27710000000. ZigBee defines this special Extended PAN
ID so that devices built by many OEMs can all be commissioned in the same way.

这些刚拿出来的设备会加入PAN ID为0x00f0c27710000000的commissioning network。

think of it as two step process. First, get on the commissioning network and receive the
commissioned data. Then, reset the node to join the operating network, and complete the
commissioning process (see Figure 8.5).

先加入一个commissioning network，获取commissioned data后，复位设备，加入到operating network完成这个过程。

If it is expected that there will only be multiple installers in any given vicinity, then the
ZigBee standard commissioning extended PAN ID, 0x00f0c27710000000, is used only to
get the extended PAN ID of the commissioning tool itself. Then the node is reset (via the
Commissioning Cluster) to go onto the commissioning tool’s PAN. ZigBee reserves the
Extended PAN ID range of 0x00f0c27710000001 to 0x00f0c2771000ffff for the purpose
of commissioning tools.


The example in this section, “CommercialCommissioning,” uses the following nodes:
● ZcNcbCommissioningTool: Commissions (over-the-air) the light and switch. The
   LCD displays which node joined the commissioning network. A press of SW1
  commissions the joined node and informs it to reset to the operating network. It
 has permit-joining on.
● ZcSrbOperatingNetwork: Pre-commissioned as the operating network. It has
   permit-joining off.
● ZrSrbLight: “Generic” light that is commissioned over-the-air.
● ZrSrbSwitch: “Generic” switch that is commissioned over-the-air.

permit-joining见7.2.3 Rejoining Networks的第三点Joining a secure network if permit-joining is off。这种方式应该是slient join。

HA profile有下面的描述：

0 (Zero) if commissioned. Indicates that the device should consider itself a part of
the network indicated by the ExtendedPANId attribute. In this case it will not
perform any explicit join or rejoin operation.
